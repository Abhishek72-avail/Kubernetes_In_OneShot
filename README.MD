**1. What is Kubernetes (K8s)?**
Kubernetes ek open-source container orchestration tool hai jo Google ne banaya tha, aur ab CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) ke under maintain hota hai.

**Samjho isko ek real-life example se:**

Maan le tu ek restaurant chalata hai. Tere paas 10 chef (nodes applications) hain.

Har chef ko ek kitchen (container) chahiye. jis me khana bna sak taye hai .

Ab tu chaahta hai ki ye sab kitchen automatically setup ho, kaam karein, crash ho to restart ho, load jyada ho to naye chef hire ho jayein.

**To tu kya karega?**

👉 Tu ek manager rakhega jo sab chefs ko handle kare — ye manager hi **Kubernetes hai.**

🎯 Kubernetes kya karta hai?
Container Management: Docker containers ko run, scale, update aur monitor karta hai.

Scaling: Load zyada ho to aur containers bana deta hai; load kam ho to hata deta hai.

Self-healing: Agar koi container crash ho jaye to wo automatically dobara start kar deta hai.

Load Balancing: Requests ko evenly sab containers me distribute karta hai.

Rollout/Rollback: New version release karna aur agar dikkat aaye to purane version pe wapas jana.

Resource Optimization: CPU, memory ka best use karta hai.

Industry Demand (2025 ke hisaab se):
Har DevOps engineer se expect kiya ja raha hai ki usse Kubernetes aata ho.

AWS, Google Cloud, Azure sab me Kubernetes ka use hota hai (GKE, EKS, AKS).

Big MNCs like: Google, Amazon, Netflix, Flipkart, Infosys, TCS, Wipro etc. — sab use kar rahe hain.

Job roles:

DevOps Engineer

SRE (Site Reliability Engineer)

Cloud Engineer

Platform Engineer

🧠 Interview me kaise confidently bolna hai:
“Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform. It helps manage, scale, and deploy containerized applications automatically. For example, in a microservices-based architecture where multiple services are running in containers, Kubernetes ensures these services are up and running, distributes traffic among them, and handles failures gracefully. It also supports scaling and updates efficiently. Most companies today use Kubernetes to manage their cloud-native workloads, making it a must-have skill in the DevOps and cloud industry.”

Short line Define
“Kubernetes ek automation tool hai jo containers ko manage, scale aur deploy karne ka kaam karta hai — jisse application reliable aur scalable banta hai.”

“What is Kubernetes and why is it used?”

Mock Interview Answer (English + Hindi touch):
"Sure Sir. Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform. It is mainly used to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

For example, when we have multiple applications running in Docker containers, manually managing them becomes difficult — especially in production environments. That’s where Kubernetes comes in.

It takes care of everything — like making sure the app is always running, restarting it if it crashes, scaling it up when traffic increases, and rolling out new updates without downtime.

One simple way to understand Kubernetes is: just like a manager handles multiple workers in a factory, Kubernetes handles multiple containers in an application.

In today’s industry, almost every company that works with microservices or cloud uses Kubernetes. Companies like Google, Amazon, and Infosys expect DevOps engineers to have good knowledge of it.

So, overall, Kubernetes makes applications more reliable, scalable, and easier to manage in modern infrastructure."

🎤 Mock Interview Answer — Pure Hindi Version:
“Zaroor Sir. Kubernetes ek open-source container orchestration tool hai. Iska use hum tab karte hain jab humein kai containers ko ek sath manage, scale, aur deploy karna hota hai.

Jaise maan lijiye humne apna application Docker containers me banaya hai — ab in sab containers ko manually chalana, rokna, update karna ya scale karna mushkil ho jata hai, especially jab production me ho.

Kubernetes is process ko automate karta hai. Agar koi container crash ho jaye to use dobara chalu karta hai, traffic zyada ho to naye container chalu karta hai, aur agar naye version ka update dena ho to bina downtime ke rollout karta hai.

Main isse ek manager ke tarah samajhta hoon jo apni team ke sabhi kaam track karta hai — waise hi Kubernetes har container ka dhyan rakhta hai.

Aaj ke samay me har badi IT company — jaise TCS, Infosys, Amazon, ya Google — sabhi cloud ya DevOps projects me Kubernetes ka use karti hain. Isliye DevOps field me ye ek must-have skill ban gaya hai.”

📌 Kubernetes – Short Bullet Points for Interview:
✅ Definition:
Kubernetes ek open-source container orchestration tool hai.

⚙️ Kaam kya karta hai?

Containers ko automate karta hai (deploy, scale, update, restart).

Self-healing karta hai – agar container crash ho jaye to dobara chalu karta hai.

Load balancing karta hai – traffic ko evenly distribute karta hai.

Zero downtime ke saath new version deploy karta hai.

🧠 Simple Example:

"Jaise ek manager kaam ko employees me baantta hai, waise hi Kubernetes containers ko manage karta hai."

🌐 Kahan use hota hai?

Cloud platforms: AWS (EKS), Azure (AKS), GCP (GKE).

IT Companies: Infosys, TCS, Amazon, Google, Flipkart etc.

🎯 Kyu important hai?

Microservices aur cloud-native apps me must-have skill hai.

Industry me high demand hai for DevOps & Cloud Engineers.
